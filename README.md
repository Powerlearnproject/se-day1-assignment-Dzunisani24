Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering applies to principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It is important to technology industry as it plays a crucial role in the industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that empower various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of coding languages e.g Fortan, C
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- Writing code and building Software according to the design specifications.
Testing- conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Development- releasing the software to users or customers. 
Maintenance- providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software development.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases while agile is an interactive approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer- writes code and implements software solutions.
Quality Assurance- ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager- oversees planning, execution and delivery of the software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs-provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g visual studio
VCS- tracks changes to source code and coordinates work among team members e.g git.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines, technical debt and changing requirements. 
Strategies to overcome are communication, agile methodologies, prioritizing tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and time lines.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- testing individual components or modules of software 
Integration- testing interactions between different components or subjects.
system- testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance- testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets it's user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best response from your robot or AI assistant.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Write me a CV is vague. Write me a CV for the software developer  role using my skills I attached, for the job description in the link below.The improved prompt is more effective because it gives a clear outline of what I want and also specifics what I need from the chatbot.
