# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering applies to principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. Software plays a crucial role in the industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages e.g Fortan,C. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- writing code and building Software according to the design specifications.
Testing- conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance- providing ongoing support, updates and enhancementsto the software after deployment.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases while agile is an interactive approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- writes code and implements software solutions.
Quality Assurance- ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager- oversees planning, execution and delivery of the software projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- providing comprehensive tools for writing and debugging the code e.g visual studio.
VCS- software tools for tracking changes and coordinating work among team members e.g git
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines, technical debt and changing requirements. 
strategies for overcoming challenges- effective communication, agile methodologies and prioritizing tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and time lines.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- testing individual components or modules of software. 
Integration- testing interactions between different components or subjects.
System- testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance- testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets it's user needs.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements  in a way that helps get the best response from your robot or AI assistant.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Write me a CV is vague. Write me a CV using my skills I attached for the job description in the the link below, use keywords and phrases that are compatible with the job description. The improved prompt is more effective because it gives a clear outline of what I want and also specifics what I need.
